                The rental market in the US is largely agreed to be the worst it’s ever been, and it's a widely accepted fact living on one’s own has become a luxury. Planning for and securing stable housing without a robust support system is difficult but not impossible. The basics of doing so have been laid out in broad strokes below.

                If you just need somewhere to spend a night or two, it’s often as simple as finding friends or family who would be willing to help. These arrangements have the potential to grow and become more permanent, especially if you and whoever you’re staying with are close, but it’s important to remember that if all they offered was a place to crash, that's all that they offered. These are ideal in situations of crisis while you work toward more permanent accommodations.

                If reaching out to those you know didn’t work out, it’s time to start looking at shelters and temporary housing. If you’re a minor, there’s almost certainly an organization such as the Northwest Youth Services willing and able to give you somewhere to stay without issue and help set you up better than we ever could. If these organizations won't accept you due to having aged out however, you can still stay at a traditional shelter. The beds are often harder to secure, but there are still people there who can help you. You can use the hud.gov link above to find shelters in your area which are registered with the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.

                Often, the quickest way to find a place to live is to find others looking for someone to live with them. If you look online (facebook, craigslist, etc.,), it shouldn't take long to find people advertising a room to rent or a lease to take over. Each situation is highly unique but it’s important to get the details before you consider saying yes, and that you be aware of what securities you may or may not have. Meeting with all of the roommates (preferably multiple times) is essential, and whether you’ll be on the lease or moving in off a handshake deal is vital information. If you’re not on the lease, you will not be entitled to legal protections and need to be prepared for the worst. 
                <br><br>
                It should be noted that if you’re putting your name on a lease that a number of tenants have already signed and been living with for some time, it’s unlikely that your credit score will be a relevant factor in weather or not you’ll be approved (as should you fall through, you’re roommates would be on the hook as well). Nevertheless, it’s still a good idea to be sure that you're in good shape. Especially when it comes time to move again.
