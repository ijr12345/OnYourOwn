                Healthy Eating
              </div>
              <div class="sub-article-text">
                The key to healthy and enjoyable eating without very much money is to buy what you can cheaply and prepare it in as many different ways as you can. The precise items used from person to person will vary, but the following are some helpful guidelines.
                <br><br>
                &bull; Most satisfying meals are built around a protein, a grain, and a green. Finding what you like and keeping it stocked goes a long way.
                <br><br>
                &bull; Grains are shelf-stable when uncooked and easy to buy in bulk. A bag of rice will keep almost indefinitely and can last almost as long.
                <br><br>
                &bull; Meat and vegetables can be easily stored in a freezer for later use.
                <br><br>
                &bull; hicken breast is one of the cheapest and most called-for sources of protein. Paired with the right seasonings, it can go in most meals.
                <br><br>
                &bull; Garlic and onions are called for in just about everything.
                <br><br>
                Once you've found something that works for you, making sure it's accessible is an important piece. It's generally better to store your ingredients separate from one another once cooked to ensure that you can mix and match if you get tired of something.

                Nonperishable foods
              </div>
              <div class="sub-article-text">
                A tried and true method for making your dollar go farther while staying healthy is to stock plenty of non-perishable items. Broadly, these items fall into a few categories:
                <br><br>
                &bull; Grains and Pastas - This encompasses rice, oats, lentils, spaghetti, and everything in between. These items are cheap to buy, easy to prepare, and make it possible to turn just about anything into a meal with just a bit of time and a stovetop. Making these a staple of your diet can allow your dollar to stretch much further.
                <br><br>
                &bull; Spices and Oils - While spices and oils can be a bit of a cost upfront, it's best if you can start with at least a few as they are really what makes home cooking sustainable. If your food doesn't taste good, you won't want to eat it, but with just some salt, pepper, and garlic powder, even the blandest of chicken can be made palatable.
                <br><br>
                &bull; Canned Goods - While it's true that you could make most canned goods with fresh ingredients, it's not uncommon to lack the funds or the time. In either case, whether they be a quick way to add some veggies to your meal, or a way to ensure you're still eating when you just don't have the time, they're an important thing to have.
                <br><br>
                &bull; Sauces - Similar to spices, these exist to make sure you enjoy what you're eating. 
                <br><br>
                When looking around for these, be sure to check with your local food bank. Many facilities have these in vast quantities (due to their long lifespan) and as such, many of these kitchen essentials can be obtained for absolutely free!
