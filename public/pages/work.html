                Before you can get a job, you’ll need to apply for one, and whatever job you’re applying for, it's likely that they’ll ask to see your resume before anything else. Your resume is your foot in the door and often the way you’ll make your first impression, so it’s important to do it right.
                <br><br>
                There are many schools of thought regarding what a resume should look like, and there is no true best approach, but broadly, a resume should aim for the following:
                <br><br>
                &bull;Relevance - The items you include on your resume should matter to the job you’re applying for. 
                <br><br>
                &bull;Brevity - A resume should avoid being verbose. Say what you need to say quickly and avoid going over a page if you can.
                <br><br>
                &bull;Clarity - Your format and organization on the page should be easy to read and important items should stand out. 
                <br><br>
                For more specific help with a resume, there are numerous resources online including templates and specific advice on the methodology of the resume. We’ve included one such website in the links above.
                <br><br>
                Once you have your resume ready and written, it’s time to print it. If you don’t have easy access to a printer, most public libraries have computers and printers you should be able to use free of charge.

              <div class="sub-article-text">
                Once you’ve built a resume and begun the application and interview processes, it's important to make sure that you're ready to accept a position once you're offered one, and if you don’t have the necessary identification for one reason or another, then you’ll be in trouble.
                <br><br>
                In the United States, in order to be able to be legally employed, you need to present one or two forms of ID to your employer. 
                <br><br>
                If you have one of the following, you are legally able to work:
                <br><br>
                &bull;An unexpired United States passport
                <br><br>
                &bull;An unexpired foreign passport with an I-551 stamp
                <br><br>
                &bull;An alien registration receipt card or permanent resident card
                <br><br>
                &bull;An unexpired employment authorization card
                <br><br>
                &bull;An unexpired employment authorization document, issued by USCIS, which contains a photograph, or an unexpired foreign passport with Form I-94 containing an endorsement of nonimmigrant status.
                <br><br>
                If you don’t have one of the above documents, you will need one the following to prove you can work:                <br><br>
                &bull;A Social Security Card
                <br><br>
                &bull;A US birth or birth abroad certificate
                <br><br>
                &bull;A US birth or birth abroad certificate
                <br><br>
                &bull;A US Citizenship ID card
                <br><br>
                &bull;Unexpired Employment Authorization Documents from the US department of Homeland Security
                <br><br>
                As well as one of the following to prove your identity:
                <br><br>
                &bull;A current U.S. or Canadian driver's license that contains a photograph or description of personal characteristics
                <br><br>
                &bull;A federal, state, or local identification card with a photograph on it
                <br><br>
                &bull;A school ID card with a photograph
                <br><br>
                &bull;A voter's registration card
                <br><br>
                &bull;A U.S. military card or draft record
                <br><br>
                &bull;A military dependent's ID card
                <br><br>
                &bull;A U.S. Coast Guard Merchant Mariner card, or a Native American tribal document
                <br><br>
                If you don’t have the necessary documents as outlined above, but know where they are, a great number of them are easily obtained through a government website, admittedly for a small fee. We’ve included links to where you can get the most commonly used of these documents, though if you need something that is not on this list, a quick online search will likely yield the results you’re looking for.
