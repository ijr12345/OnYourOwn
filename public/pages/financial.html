                Once you've established a steady source of income, the next step is to find a safe place to house it. A larger financial institution will do and they are often more convenient, but many swear by credit unions. Look around your area to see what's right for you, then open an account.
                <br><br>
                To do so, you will need to know your SSN, have some money to deposit, and have a valid form of government ID. If you don't have access to  one or more of these, pleas see our documents pace (LINK).
                <br><br>
                Once you've got this account, you'll want to set up direct deposit with your employer. A number of financial institutions will charge a fee if your account goes below a certain amount or if you don't receive a certain amount monthly through direct deposit. Just be sure to familiarize yourself with your institutions policies, and work to save some money.

                If you've got steady income and a reliable means of online banking, it's time to build some credit. While credit can often seem like a frivolous thing for someone without vast amounts of capitol, there is one very tangible reason to have it: housing. Without good credit, you'll need a cosigner on any lease you attempt to sign, but if you don't have one of those, you'll need to be a host unto yourself.
                <br><br>
                There are a number of cards out there, and without any existing credit, you'll be limited in your options, but whichever one you choose, make sure it has no annual fees.
                <br><br>
                Once you've got a card, however you use it, its important that you pay it off on time each and every month. This card exists to open doors, not to get you into debt. Its best to stay below 30 percent utilization overall, but if you worried about it, you can always do the tried and true method of putting a small recurring charge on it (such as a phone bill) and leaving the card in a drawer.
                <br><br>
                If you do plan to use it in the world but are worried about not being able to pay it off, you can always look into secure credit cards. These are cards where you pit in a sum of money as collateral so that in the event you can't pay the card off, your collateral will.
