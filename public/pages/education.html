                Getting Your GED
              </div>
              <div class="sub-article-text">
                If your individual situation has, or is going to, prevent you from graduating highschool, it’s important to remember that education should still be on your mind. Many jobs require that applicants have a highschool diploma or equivalent certification before they will even be considered, and failing to have one can easily hold you back in your pursuit of financial security and employment. Any highschool equivalency will do the job when the time comes, but the GED (General Education Development) is the most widely accepted at institutions throughout the United States.
                <br><br>
                The test itself is split into four sections which can be completed all at once or one at a time (depending on the schedule of the testing facility you decide to take it at). In all, the exam takes just over 7 hours to complete and covers the following topics:
                <br><br>
                &Tab;&bull;Language Arts, 150 minutes
                <br><br>
                &Tab;&bull;Social Studies, 70 minutes
                <br><br>
                &Tab;&bull;Mathematics, 115 minutes
                <br><br>
                &Tab;&bull;Science, 90 minutes
                <br><br>
                The GED test is not free, and costs 36 dollars per subject test, or 144 for the entire suite. If you plan to take the test online, there are also additional fees which bring the cost up to 172 dollars, and for this reason, it’s important to ensure you won't need to take it twice. Official study materials are available for free through the GED’s site, though more hands-on education often comes with a price. This is not always the case however, so be sure to look around in your community or online to see if there are any resources in this regard which you can make use of. Once you feel you’re ready, it's time to take the test and see what options open up for you.

                Paying for College or University
              </div>
              <div class="sub-article-text">
                If you’ve decided to broaden your horizons and pursue a college or university degree, great news! There are tons of resources which exist to make this possible! While you may not be able to afford the tuition of an ivy league, a state school's tuition can often be largely, if not entirely, covered through financial aid in the form of grants, scholarships, and loans.
                <br><br>
                You should begin by filling out your Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FASFA. College is difficult for just about everyone to pay for, but in some ways, you may have a leg up. The government knows that those below the poverty line don’t have money to contribute towards tuition, and as such, you’ll likely qualify for a number of substantial grants reserved for others like you such as the federal Pell grant. As you prepare to fill out the FASFA, please consider the following:
                <br><br>
                &bull;Pay attention to when the FASFA opens. Often it’s in October, but this is not alway the case. Filling it out early and sending it out is the best way to make sure colleges make room for you ang gives you ample time to fix any mistakes with your form.
                <br><br>
                &bull;If you, like many others, do not have the financial support of your parents, be sure that your FASFA reflects this. The school’s you apply to will likely reach out to verify this with you, but once they do so, you should be in the clear.
                <br><br>
                &bull;Once you do hear back from the financial aid office, speak with them about any other grants or scholarships you may be eligible for and you will likely find more avenues for financial support.
                <br><br>
                Once you’ve secured your financial aid, you should be set to afford college or close to it. You may still need to work as you pursue this education, but balancing work and school, while not always easy, should prove a manageable task if you’ve made it this far.
